\section{Introduction}
Currently, we are all living in a social system under capitalism. Every enterprise is competing with each other with their own products, services and even user experience. With the rapid growth of the internet in recent year, user experience can be further improved via processing huge data on costumer's review and rating. The Large internet-based retailer, like Amazon, have an enormous number of products but obviously, not all of them are popular. Therefore, processing costumer's review and rating of a product is vital for improving user experience thus increasing profit.\\

In order to determine the popularity of a product, an explicit way is to process costumer's review and rating. Nonetheless, the number of responses on a product would not always be sufficiently large enough for reference. In other words, we have a sparse dataset with users versus rating. With the help of matrix completion helps to extend the sparse data and return an estimated complete data matrix for further processing. In the Amazon Fine Food Reviews, there are user's scores on different products and our goal is to investigate the popularity of products. This will benefit online retailer to promote further actions to enhance user experience and yield more revenue. That is to say to shine a spotlight on popular items under "Recommended Items" to drive traffic; or to group less popular products for sale and promotions.


\section{Problem Setting}
k-singles on the comments in different rating. k can be changed, we will see the performance on different number of k. k is probably from 1 to 3\\
k-combination problem\\
So there will be 5 category and classify the comment to one of it.\\
Using Hadoop.\\
We will be writing a program that will filter out the stop words.\\
Ignoring the empty comment or defalt value.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Work 0: Pre-process : remove stop words (python)
\item Work 1: FIS (python)
\item work 2: k-singles (support = ?) mapReduce (Hadoop)
\item work 3: prediction : weight equation (
\end{enumerate}

Firstly, Put every comments into that rating category and will only left with top 100 FIS. 
The system intake the data set we will be using mapReduce of k-singles on comment and it's count.
Mapper will take in the data result will be <(shingle),<count,rating>,...>
Reducer will be <(shingle),<count,rating>,...>
When a new comment comes in we will compare its k-shingles to the result from Pre-processing result.

\section{System Structure}
In this project, we will be using python to code the system that perform pre-processing on the data set. Based on the result we can do prediction based on the comment.
\subsection{Structure Diagram}
In this subsection, we will be explaining the idea behind the system and the structure of the system.


\section{Testing}
The system will be taking 80\% of the data set to be based set and the rest as testing and improving the prediction.

Testing result is as following:
