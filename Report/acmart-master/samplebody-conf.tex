\section{Introduction}
Currently, we are all living in a social system under capitalism. Every enterprise is competing with each other with their own products, services and even user experience. With the rapid growth of the internet in recent year, user experience can be further improved via processing huge data on costumer's review and rating. The Large internet-based retailer, like Amazon, have an enormous number of products but obviously, not all of them are popular. Therefore, processing costumer's review and rating of a product is vital for improving user experience thus increasing profit.\\
In order to determine the popularity of a product, an explicit way is to process costumer's review and rating. Nonetheless, the number of responses on a product would not always be sufficiently large enough for reference. In the Amazon Fine Food Reviews, there are user's scores and reviews on different products and our goal is to investigate the popularity of products by these two factors. This will benefit online retailer to promote further actions to enhance user experience and yield more revenue. Moreover, the system would be able to do predication of rating of the product based on the comment.


\section{Problem Setting}
k-singles on the comments in different rating. k can be changed, we will see the performance on different number of k. k is probably from 1 to 3\\
k-combination problem\\
So there will be 5 category and classify the comment to one of it.\\
Using Hadoop.\\
We will be writing a program that will filter out the stop words.\\
Ignoring the empty comment or defalt value.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Work 0: Pre-process : remove stop words (python)
\item Work 1: FIS (python)
\item work 2: k-singles (support = ?) mapReduce (Hadoop)
\item work 3: prediction : weight equation (
\end{enumerate}

Firstly, Put every comments into that rating category and will only left with top 100 FIS. 
The system intake the data set we will be using mapReduce of k-singles on comment and it's count.
Mapper will take in the data result will be <(shingle),<count,rating>,...>
Reducer will be <(shingle),<count,rating>,...>
When a new comment comes in we will compare its k-shingles to the result from Pre-processing result.

\section{System Structure}
In this project, we will be using python to code the system that perform processing on the data set. There are three stages in the whole system, we will be explaining the idea and coding in the following subsections. Based on the result generated by each stage we can do prediction of rating based on the give comment.
\subsection{Stage 1}
In this subsection, we will be explaining the idea behind stage one, pre-processing. As only small portion of the given data are useful in this project, we need to do pre-processing before doing other applications.\\
During the pre-process, we will extract rating column, summary column and comment column of each review record. Moreover, we will remove all punctations and selected stopwords from comment part and left with only meaningful words. We need to preserve some stopwords because it effect the real meaning of the comment. For example, "Good" and "Not Good". If we remove stopword "Not", the meaning of the comment is completely reversed.\\
Let us observe part of the original data and the result from pre-processing before we explain how we do pre-processing.\\

  \begin{tabular}{ | p{9cm} | }

\end{table}

The original data file is in format of \(.cvs\), each column is separated by a comma and each row is separated by a linebreak. Each row have the format : \{Id , ProductId, UserId, ProfileName, HelpfullnessNumerator, HelpfullnessDenominator, Score, Time, Summary, Text\}. As mentioned before, the only important parts are Score, Summary and Text. Thus, the resulting data have format : \{Score, Summary, Text\}.\\

\section{Testing}
The system will be taking 80\% of the data set to be based set and the rest as testing and improving the prediction.

Testing result is as following:
