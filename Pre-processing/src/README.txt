Just put the review.csv inside the src folder and run the java program and it will generate the result.csv inside the src folder.
The list of stopword is in the stopword.txt. It can be modify to fit our needs, I only removed the 'Not' in the list.
The program also removes all the punctuation in the comment section and I also save the summary part as well.
Format of output : Rating, Summary, Text
